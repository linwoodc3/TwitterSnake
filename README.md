####Set up your AWS Environment through the AWS Management Console
First things first, we need to set up the environment that will be used to host this application. 

To get started, we need to spin up an EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) instance. We will be using an Ubuntu image pre-loaded with Anaconda, which you can read about [here](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/images#id4). You can follow these steps or, for a more detailed explanation, follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html?console_help=true)...
  1. Access your AWS Management Console [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1)
      * Make sure you log in!
  2. Select **EC2** from the **Compute** section
  3. Select **Launch Instance**
  4. From the left-hand navigation pane, select **Community AMIs**
  5. Using the search bar, search for *anaconda* and select Anaconda on Ubuntu from continuum analytics.
      * It should be named similarly to *anaconda3-2.4.1-on-ubuntu-14.04-lts - ami-1cd89176* 
  6. Select the **t1.micro** instance type
  9. Launch your new instance!
  10. From the main EC2 management page, find the **Network & Security** section, and select **Security Groups**
  11. Select **Create new security group**
  12. Name your security group something meaningful, add a description (if you want), and leave the VPC as it defaults
  13. In the **Inbound** tab, select **Add Rule**
  14. For the type, select **HTTP**
  15. Select **Add a rule** again, and select **SSH** as the type
  16. For the source, select **My IP** if you only want to allow connection from your current IP address, or enter a custom IP address (that you have access too, obviously)
  17. Select the **Outbound** tab
  18. You'll notice **All traffic** already added; this is okay, leave it.
  19. Select **Add a rule**, then select **HTTPS** as the type. 
      * This is required so that your EC2 instance can communicate using AWS CLI
  20. Select **Create**
  21. Now your done! Your EC2 instance is spun up and ready to go!
  
Now, we will create the S3 (Simple Storage Solution) bucket to store our collected tweets. You'll need to navigate back to your Management Console [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1).
  1. Select **S3** from the **Storage & Content Deliver** section
  2. Select **Create Bucket**
  3. Name your bucket something fun (and useful)
  4. Select your region (to optimize for latency)
  5. [OPTIONAL] Set up logging. You won't really need this for the purpose of this guide.
  6. Create your bucket!
  
Finally, we need to create an IAM (Identity & Access Management) User so your python program can access your AWS resources. As usual, you'll need to navigate back to your Management Console [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1).
  1. Select **Identity & Access Management** from the **Security and Identity** section
  2. Select **Users** from the left-hand navigation pane
  3. Select **Create New Users**
  4. Name your user something useful (and fun)
  5. Make sure to check the box for the option to **Generate an Access Key for each user**
  6. Select **Create**
  7. Make sure to **download your credentials** from this page and save them somewhere you'll remember... you'll need these later
  8. Now select **close** to close the page (you have to press the button twice)
  9. Now that your back to your **Users** window, select the user you just created by clicking on the name
  10. Select the **Permissions** tab
  11. Select **Attach Policy**
  12. The only resource we will need to access is your S3 bucket, so search for the **AmazonS3FullAccess** policy and **attach it**
  13. You're done!

####Set up putty in order to SSH into EC2 instance
  In order to connect to your EC2 instance, please follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html)
  
####Set up your anaconda envinronment
   Once you're inside of your EC2 instance, you'll be in control of a simple Ubuntu machine with Anaconda pre-installed. Through these instructions, you'll be able to develop a simple python program to connect to the twitter streaming api
   1. Run the command **conda create --name <name of your envirnment> **
   2. Run the command **source activate <name of your environment> **
   3. Now that you're in your environment, you can install some packages that Anaconda does not include
   4. Run the command **pip install boto3**
   5. Run the command **pip install awscli**
   6. Run the command **pip install botocore**
   7. Run the command **pip install tweepy**
   8. Now, you should have all of the packages that you need in your conda environment
